# This code takes calibration points from two camera perspectives, obtains
# a calibration matrix and performs a triangulation on tracked markers 
# The code was developed first with George Hale during a MSci project.
# This is the second more automated version and was written by Anne-Kristin
# Lenz in November 2020 for the analysis of drop impact on leaf surfaces 
# experiments conducted in the Botanical Garden 2020.
